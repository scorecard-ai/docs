<Update label="July 25, 2025">
  ### üìä Run History
  
  We've added a new Run History visualization to help you track evaluation performance over time. The chart displays aggregate scores per run, making it easy to spot trends and regressions across your metrics. You can view this directly on the run details page to see how your model's performance evolves with each iteration.

  ### üîç Tracing improvements
  
  We've upgraded our tracing infrastructure to provide better observability into your AI systems:
  
  - **Open-source collector architecture**: Migrated to the upstream OpenTelemetry standard collector on Railway for improved reliability and performance
  - **Unified API key authentication**: You can now use your existing Scorecard API key for tracing so you no longer need to manage separate authentication tokens
  - **New tracing integration**: Published official integrations for Vercel AI SDK and OpenLLMetry with examples in both Python and Node.js. Our new [step-by-step guide](https://docs.scorecard.io/intro/tracing-quickstart) gets you from zero to traced LLM calls in minutes
  
  ### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes and Improvements
  
  - **[Run kickoff]** Fixed an issue with models not scrolling correctly in Run Kickoff modal UI
  - **[Run details]** Metrics cards and score columns are now consistently sorted alphabetically
  - **[Run details]** Sorting a column now displays the sort direction
</Update>

<Update label="July 18, 2025">
  ### Separate Score Columns

  On the run details page, each metric now has its own column of scores, rather than a single column for all metrics. This makes it easier to compare the scores across records for a particular metric. It also enables sorting records by a metric's score.

  ### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes and Improvements

  - **[Performance]** Improved loading time of the Runs list page.
  - **[Runs]** Added a new "Run Again" button to the Run details page, allowing you to re-run the same testset/system combo with the same metrics and model parameters.
  - **[Runs]** Added "System Version" link to the Run details page.
</Update>

<Update label="July 11, 2025">
  ### üöÄ Onboarding Improvements

  We've streamlined the onboarding process for new organizations with several key improvements:

  - **Automatic defaults**: New organizations now receive default projects, testsets, metrics, and prompts automatically, significantly reducing initial setup time
  - **Free API key included**: Every new organization gets a default free API key (Gemini Flash), eliminating the need for initial user configuration. Users without their own API key will be clearly notified that the system is defaulting to the free API

  ### üèÉ Kickoff Runs from Playground

  You can now trigger runs directly from the Playground and view them in the runs & results section. We're considering adding scoring capabilities from the Playground as well - let us know if this is important to your team!

  ![Trigger runs directly from the Playground](/images/playground/kickoff-runs.gif)

  ### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes and Improvements

<Update label="June 13, 2025">
  ### üéØ Metric API

  We've launched new API endpoints for programmatic metric management, enabling teams to [create](https://docs.scorecard.io/api-reference/create-metric) and [update](https://docs.scorecard.io/api-reference/update-metric) metrics directly through our SDK. Create metrics with full control over evaluation type, output format, and prompt templates:

  ```python
  client.metrics.create(
      project_id="314",
      name="Response Accuracy",
      eval_type="ai",
      output_type="boolean",
      prompt_template="Evaluate if the following response is factually accurate: {{outputs.response}}",
  )
  ```

  These endpoints are supported in SDK versions [1.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scorecard-ai) (JS) and [2.1.0](https://pypi.org/project/scorecard-ai/) (Python).

  ### üéØ Improved API key format

  We switched to a new API key format, which supports having multiple API keys, revoking them, and setting expiry dates. Our new API keys are more concise (94% shorter\!) than the previously unwieldy API keys based on JWTs. We've deprecated the old API key format, but will continue to support them until July 20, 2025.

  ![New API key management interface showing multiple keys and expiry options](/images/api_key.png)

  ### Bug fixes and improvements

  - **[Metrics]** Improved metrics management UI with tabbed sections for better organization
  - **[Metrics]** Added metric selector with searchable dropdown - no more manually typing metric IDs

  ![Metric selector with searchable dropdown](/images/metric_group.png)

<Update label="June 10, 2025">
  ### üöÄ SDK v2 Stable Release

  Following our May 30th launch, SDK v2 is now fully stable and battle-tested. The new SDK features simplified APIs with ergonomic helper methods like `runAndEvaluate` (JS/TS) and `run_and_evaluate` (Python), making it easier than ever to integrate evaluations into your workflow.

  We've made the SDK even more flexible - `testset_id` is now optional in our helper methods, allowing you to run evaluations with custom inputs without requiring a pre-defined testset. Additional improvements include:

  - System configurations for experimenting with different model settings
  - Enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities
  - Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions

  Available now on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scorecard-ai) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scorecard-ai/)\!

  ### üéØ Basic and Advanced Metric Modes

  We've introduced a two-mode system for creating and editing metrics, making Scorecard accessible to users at every technical level.

  Basic mode simplifies metric creation by focusing solely on the evaluation guidelines - just describe what you want to measure in plain language without worrying about prompt templates or variables. Advanced mode gives power users full control over the entire prompt template, including variable handling and custom formatting.

  ![Metric editor interface showing Basic and Advanced mode options](/images/metric_.png)

  ### Bug fixes and improvements

  - **[Documentation]** Streamlined quickstart guide for faster onboarding

  ### üîå Scorecard MCP Server

  We've published an MCP server for Scorecard, enabling powerful new integration possibilities\! MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. This allows your Scorecard evaluations to seamlessly connect with AI systems. This lets you integrate your evaluation data with various AI tools through a single protocol rather than maintaining separate integrations for each service.

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aM79Cn6hiCo" title="Scorecard MCP Server Overview" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen />

  ### üíØ Scorecard Eval Day\!

  We recently held our first Scorecard Evaluation Day with a cohort of inception-stage founders who are deeply invested in their AI agents' quality. During the event, we exchanged valuable ideas around evaluation goals and methodologies, had thoughtful discussions about defining meaningful metrics, and explored approaches to evaluation (including the Scorecard method) and integrating evaluation into CI/CD pipelines. Thanks to everyone who attended\! We greatly appreciate the insightful feedback from these teams and have already implemented several improvements to our UI flows and SDK integration patterns based on your input.

  ![Scorecard Eval Day event poster](/images/eval_day.png)

</Update>


<Update label="April 18, 2025">
  ### Run insights

  We've added a new Run History chart on Runs & Results that visualises your performance trends over time to spot regressions or sustained improvements at a glance (up and to the right\!).  The x‚Äëaxis is the run date, the y‚Äëaxis is the mean score, and each metric gets its own colored line. You can view this by clicking on the 'All Runs' tab of Runs & Results.

  ![Run History](/images/run_history.png)

  ### üß™ Testsets 2.0 for Easier creation and iteration

  Testsets got a full upgrade. We reworked the creation flow, added AI-powered example generation, and streamlined testcase iteration. Filtering, sorting, editing, and bulk actions are now faster and more intuitive‚Äîso you can ship better tests, faster.

  - You can now create testsets with a simplified modal and generate relevant example testcases based on title and description.
  - Bulk editing tools make it easier to manage and update multiple testcases at once.
  - You can edit large JSON blobs inline in the testcase detail view, with improved scroll and copy behavior.

</Update>


<Update label="April 4, 2025">
  ### Tracing

  We've significantly improved our trace management system by relocating traces within the project hierarchy for better organization. Users can now leverage robust search capabilities with full-text search across trace data, complete with highlighted match previews. The new date range filtering system offers multiple time range options from 30 minutes to all time, while project scope filtering allows viewing traces from either the current project or across all projects. We've enhanced data visualization with dynamic activity charts and improved trace tables for better insights. Our library support now focuses specifically on Traceloop, OpenLLMetry, and OpenTelemetry for optimal integration.

  In addition, the trace system now includes intelligent AI span detection that automatically recognizes AI operations across different providers. Visual AI indicators with special badges clearly show model information at a glance. We've added test case generation capabilities that extract prompts and completions to easily create test cases. For better resource monitoring, token usage tracking provides detailed metrics for LLM consumption.

  ![Tracing](/images/tracing.png)

  ### Examples repository

  We've published comprehensive integration examples demonstrating OpenTelemetry configuration with Scorecard, including Python Flask implementation with LLM tracing for OpenAI and Node.js Express implementation with similar capabilities. A new setup wizard provides clear configuration instructions for popular telemetry libraries to help users get started quickly.

  We also updated our quickstart documentation to be more comprehensive.
