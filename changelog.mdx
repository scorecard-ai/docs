  ### üöÄ SDK v2 Stable Release

  Following our May 30th launch, SDK v2 is now fully stable and battle-tested. The new SDK features simplified APIs with ergonomic helper methods like `runAndEvaluate` (JS/TS) and `run_and_evaluate` (Python), making it easier than ever to integrate evaluations into your workflow.

  We've made the SDK even more flexible - `testset_id` is now optional in our helper methods, allowing you to run evaluations with custom inputs without requiring a pre-defined testset. Additional improvements include:

  - System configurations for experimenting with different model settings
  - Enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities
  - Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions

  Available now on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scorecard-ai) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scorecard-ai/). Check out our [migration guide](/sdk-migration-guide) to upgrade from v1 - most migrations take less than 15 minutes.

  ### üéØ Basic and Advanced Metric Modes

  We've introduced a two-mode system for creating and editing metrics, making Scorecard accessible to users at every technical level.

  Basic mode simplifies metric creation by focusing solely on the evaluation guidelines - just describe what you want to measure in plain language without worrying about prompt templates or variables. Advanced mode gives power users full control over the entire prompt template, including variable handling and custom formatting.

  ### Bug fixes and improvements

  - **[Documentation]** Streamlined quickstart guide for faster onboarding
  - **[Playground]** More detailed error messages and prominent results table button
  - **[Runs]** Delete runs directly from the runs list page
  - **[Runs]** Run status now updates automatically based on scoring progress
  - **[Platform]** Fixed data invalidation bugs when managing metrics and testcases
</Update>

<Update label="May 30, 2025">
  ### üîß Metric Groups

  We've introduced metric groups (formerly scoring configs) to streamline how you manage and organize your evaluation metrics. Create custom groups of metrics that can be applied to runs with a single selection, making it easier to maintain consistent evaluation standards across your projects. Manage metric groups through an intuitive UI and apply them directly when triggering runs.

<Update label="May 2, 2025">
  ### üîå Scorecard MCP Server

  We've published an MCP server for Scorecard, enabling powerful new integration possibilities\! MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. This allows your Scorecard evaluations to seamlessly connect with AI systems. This lets you integrate your evaluation data with various AI tools through a single protocol rather than maintaining separate integrations for each service.

  ### üíØ Scorecard Eval Day\!

  We recently held our first Scorecard Evaluation Day with a cohort of inception-stage founders who are deeply invested in their AI agents' quality. During the event, we exchanged valuable ideas around evaluation goals and methodologies, had thoughtful discussions about defining meaningful metrics, and explored approaches to evaluation (including the Scorecard method) and integrating evaluation into CI/CD pipelines. Thanks to everyone who attended\! We greatly appreciate the insightful feedback from these teams and have already implemented several improvements to our UI flows and SDK integration patterns based on your input.

  ### üìö In-App Documentation Search

  We've launched in-app documentation search, making it easier to find exactly what you need without leaving the platform. Now you can quickly search through all of Scorecard's documentation directly within the application. You can access it by pressing Cmd K or clicking the search docs button in the top right.

  ![Screenshot of the in-app documentation search feature (QA Docsbot)](/images/qa_docsbot.png)

  ### üë∑ SDK v2 Beta

  We've added ergonomic methods to our SDKs to make integration even more seamless. The helper functions `runAndEvaluate` in the [JS/TS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scorecard-ai) and `run_and_evaluate` in the [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/scorecard-ai/) let you easily evaluate systems against testcases and metrics.

  ### üîß Scorecard Playground Scheduled Maintenance

  We are taking the Scorecard Cloud playground offline for maintenance and upgrades starting May 7th. Note this will not affect custom integrations (e.g. GitHub kickoff). Please reach out to the team at [team@scorecard.io](mailto:team@scorecard.io) or via direct message if you have a workflow that will be affected by this\!

</Update>

<Update label="April 18, 2025">
  ### Run insights

  We‚Äôve added a new Run History chart on Runs‚ÄØ&‚ÄØResults that visualises your performance trends over time to spot regressions or sustained improvements at a glance (up and to the right\!). ‚ÄØThe x‚Äëaxis is the run date, the y‚Äëaxis is the mean score, and each metric gets its own colored line. You can view this by clicking on the ‚ÄòAll Runs‚Äô tab of Runs & Results.

  ![Run History](/images/run_history.png)

  ### üß™ Testsets 2.0 for Easier creation and iteration

  Testsets got a full upgrade. We reworked the creation flow, added AI-powered example generation, and streamlined testcase iteration. Filtering, sorting, editing, and bulk actions are now faster and more intuitive‚Äîso you can ship better tests, faster.

  - You can now create testsets with a simplified modal and generate relevant example testcases based on title and description.
  - Bulk editing tools make it easier to manage and update multiple testcases at once.
  - You can edit large JSON blobs inline in the testcase detail view, with improved scroll and copy behavior.
  - The testset detail page now shows the associated schema in context for easier debugging and review.
  - Navigation has improved with linked testset titles and run/testcase summaries directly accessible from the cards.

  - **[Testcases]** We fixed a bug that broke the Generate testcases feature.
  - **[Settings]** We added some text on the API keys page to clarify that your Scorecard API key is personal, but model API keys are scoped to the organization.
</Update>

<Update label="April 4, 2025">
  ### Tracing

  We've significantly improved our trace management system by relocating traces within the project hierarchy for better organization. Users can now leverage robust search capabilities with full-text search across trace data, complete with highlighted match previews. The new date range filtering system offers multiple time range options from 30 minutes to all time, while project scope filtering allows viewing traces from either the current project or across all projects. We've enhanced data visualization with dynamic activity charts and improved trace tables for better insights. Our library support now focuses specifically on Traceloop, OpenLLMetry, and OpenTelemetry for optimal integration.

  In addition, the trace system now includes intelligent AI span detection that automatically recognizes AI operations across different providers. Visual AI indicators with special badges clearly show model information at a glance. We've added test case generation capabilities that extract prompts and completions to easily create test cases. For better resource monitoring, token usage tracking provides detailed metrics for LLM consumption.

  ![Tracing](/images/tracing.png)

  ### Examples repository

  We've published comprehensive integration examples demonstrating OpenTelemetry configuration with Scorecard, including Python Flask implementation with LLM tracing for OpenAI and Node.js Express implementation with similar capabilities. A new setup wizard provides clear configuration instructions for popular telemetry libraries to help users get started quickly.

  We also updated our quickstart documentation to be more comprehensive.

  ![Examples](/images/examples.png)

  ### Bug fixes and improvements

  - **[Prompt Management]** We made stability and performance improvements to prompt management workflows.
  - **[Projects]** All resources now belong to projects, including those created before Scorecard Projects were introduced.
  - **[Exports]** Custom fields in CSV exports of run results are handled more reliably.
  - **[Organizations]** When a user switches organizations, we now redirect them to the organization's projects page.
  - **[Testsets]** On the testcase page, we fixed the link back to the testset.
  - **[Metrics]** We added a new autosize textarea component that lets you keep typing the metric description without running out of space.
  - **[Playground]** The "Prompt manager", "Update", and "Delete prompt" buttons are now disabled for default prompts. When selecting metrics, the "Select and score now" button is now the primary button rather than the "Select" button.
  - **[API]** When a user does not include their Scorecard API key, we now return a friendlier 401 error: "Missing API key" rather than "malformed token".
  - **[Scoring]** The human scoring panel collapses the run details page allowing users to see model responses and while scoring.
  - **[Platform]** We enhanced platform stability and increased test coverage.
</Update>
