title: "Prompt Management"

<Note>
When it comes to large language models (LLMs), a prompt refers to the specific instructions a user provides to produce an expected output.

## Key Concepts

Before diving in, let's understand the basic concepts of prompt management:

- **Prompt**: The input text that tells an LLM what you want it to do
- **Prompt Version**: Different variations of the same prompt as you refine it
- **Prompt ID**: A unique identifier that helps track specific prompts
- **System Message**: Instructions that set the context for the LLM
- **User Message**: The actual input or question for the LLM
- **Assistant Message**: Previous responses that provide context

## Why Prompt Management Matters

Managing prompts effectively is crucial because:

- You'll likely test many variations to find the best prompt
- Different use cases need different prompts
- Teams need to track which prompts work best
- Successful prompts should be easy to reuse
- Version control helps track improvements

## Managing Prompts with Scorecard

Scorecard makes it easy to organize and improve your prompts. Here's how:

### 1. View All Your Prompts in One Place

The Prompts view gives you a central dashboard where you can:
- Search for specific prompts
- Sort prompts by date or name
- Get detailed information about important prompts
- Archive prompts you no longer need

### 2. Create New Prompts Easily

Creating a prompt is simple:

1. Click the `New Prompt +` button
2. Fill in basic information like name and description
3. Choose your LLM model (with helpful info boxes for guidance)
4. Add your prompt messages

#### Model Selection Made Simple

Not sure which model to use? Scorecard helps you choose:
- Interactive info boxes explain each model
- Clear descriptions of model capabilities
- Easy-to-understand performance comparisons

#### Structure Your Prompts

Break down your prompts into clear components:
- **System Messages**: Set the context and rules
- **User Messages**: Your actual questions or inputs
- **Assistant Messages**: Previous responses for context

### 3. Quick Prompt Creation in the Playground

Two easy ways to work with prompts in the Playground:

1. Create a new prompt directly:
   - Fill in the message fields
   - Test immediately
   - Save if it works well

2. Use existing prompts:
   - Search from the dropdown menu
   - Select and modify as needed
   - Save new versions

### 4. Track Prompts with Unique IDs

Every prompt gets a unique ID that helps you:
- Find specific prompts quickly
- Track performance across different runs
- Reference prompts in documentation
- Share prompts with team members

### 5. Version Control for Prompts

Keep track of how your prompts evolve:
- See all versions of a prompt in one place
- Know which version is in production
- Compare changes between versions
- Rollback to previous versions if needed

<Tip>
Start with a simple prompt and iterate gradually. Save each significant improvement as a new version to track your progress.
