title: "Testset Management"
description: "A Scorecard Testset is a collection of Testcases used to evaluate the performance of an LLM application across a variety of inputs and scenarios."
---

## Quick Reference
- **Testset**: A collection of test cases focused on a specific theme or functionality
- **Testcase**: An individual test consisting of a user query and optional components
- **Creation Methods**: Create via UI (basic) or SDK (advanced/custom schemas)
- **Best Practice**: Start small with 5-20 test cases and gradually expand

## What is a Testset?

A Testset is a group of related test cases that help you evaluate how well your LLM application performs. Think of it like a quiz for your AI - each question (test case) checks a specific aspect of your application's capabilities.

Common Testset themes include:
- Core Functionality Tests
- Edge Case Scenarios
- Adversarial Tests (challenging cases)
- User Experience Validation

## Anatomy of a Testcase

Each Testcase in your Testset contains these components:

<Card title="Essential Components" icon="puzzle-piece">
- **User Query**: The input text or prompt sent to your LLM
- **Context** (optional): Additional information like document snippets or conversation history
- **Ideal Response** (optional): The expected "correct" answer from your LLM
- **Custom Fields**: Additional fields you can add for special testing needs

## Best Practices from the Scorecard Team

Our team of LLM evaluation experts recommends these key practices:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Regular Review and Updates" icon="rotate">
    - Review test cases periodically
    - Update as your application evolves
    - Remove outdated test cases
    - Add tests for new features
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Diverse Test Coverage" icon="layer-group">
    - Include various input types
    - Test edge cases
    - Cover different user scenarios
    - Test error handling
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Team Collaboration" icon="users">
    - Share test cases with team members
    - Get feedback on test coverage
    - Agree on performance priorities
    - Document test case rationale
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Types of Testsets: From Small to Big

Choose the right type of Testset based on your needs:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hillclimbing Testsets" icon="mountain">
    **Size**: 5-20 test cases
    - Your first Testset type
    - Focuses on favorite prompts
    - Great for quick improvements
    - Based on real usage examples
  </Card>

  <Card title="Regression Testsets" icon="chart-line">
    **Size**: 50-100 test cases
    - Regular testing (often nightly)
    - Prevents feature regression
    - Representative use cases
    - Monitors core functionality
  </Card>

  <Card title="Launch Evaluation Testsets" icon="rocket">
    **Size**: 100+ test cases
    - Pre-launch comprehensive testing
    - Broad coverage
    - High confidence validation
    - Critical for major updates
  </Card>

  <Card title="Must-Pass Testsets" icon="shield-check">
    **Size**: Varies by need
    - High-precision test cases
    - Critical functionality checks
    - Required for deployments
    - Early warning system
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Start small with a Hillclimbing Testset and gradually expand your test coverage as your application matures. This approach helps you build a robust testing foundation without getting overwhelmed.
