## Quick Start Summary ðŸš€

Scorecard helps you evaluate your LLM applications in three simple steps:

1. **Add your test data** - Upload examples that represent your use case
2. **Run your tests** - Execute your LLM application against these examples
3. **Get results** - Review automated or manual scoring of your LLM's performance

## The Scorecard Workflow Explained

Let's break down each step of using Scorecard to evaluate your LLM application.

### Step 1: Adding Your Test Data ðŸ“¥

<Note>
This is where you prepare the foundation for testing your LLM application.
</Note>

In this first step, you:
- Create a collection of test cases that represent real-world usage
- Upload your examples through our UI or API
- Organize your test data into meaningful sets

### Step 2: Running Your Tests âš¡

<Note>
This is where your LLM application processes the test cases you've added.
</Note>

During this step:
- Your LLM application processes each test case
- Scorecard captures all inputs and outputs
- Results are stored for analysis

### Step 3: Getting Your Results ðŸ“Š

<Note>
This is where you see how well your LLM application performs.
</Note>

In the final step:
- Each test case result is evaluated
- Scoring can be:
  - Automatic (using Scorecard's AI models)
  - Manual (reviewed by your team's experts)
- You get detailed insights about your LLM's performance
