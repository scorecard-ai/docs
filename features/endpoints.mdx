## What are Custom Endpoints?

Custom Endpoints enable no-code testing of any HTTP API through Scorecard's evaluation interface. Unlike SDK integration that requires code changes, Custom Endpoints let you point Scorecard directly at your existing APIs for immediate testing and monitoring. This approach is particularly valuable for teams who want to evaluate deployed services without modifying application code, test third-party APIs they don't control, or quickly validate endpoints during development cycles.

The feature transforms any HTTP endpoint into a testable system within Scorecard's evaluation framework. You can test REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, webhooks, or any HTTP-accessible service while leveraging Scorecard's full suite of metrics and monitoring capabilities. This bridges the gap between your deployed APIs and Scorecard's evaluation platform, enabling comprehensive testing without development overhead.

## Creating an Endpoint

Navigate to your project's **Endpoints** section to create and manage custom endpoints.

### Configuration Benefits

Setting up a Custom Endpoint is straightforward and requires minimal technical overhead. You provide basic details like the endpoint name, HTTP method, and URL, then configure authentication headers and request structure through Scorecard's intuitive interface. The system handles complex aspects like request formatting, response parsing, and error handling automatically.

Dynamic variable injection makes endpoints incredibly flexible for testing. Using simple template syntax, you can inject values from your test cases directly into request bodies or headers. This means a single endpoint configuration can handle diverse test scenarios without requiring separate configurations for each variation.

Response path extraction ensures you're evaluating the right data from complex API responses. Instead of evaluating entire JSON payloads, you can focus metrics on specific response fields using JSONPath expressions. This precision makes evaluations more meaningful and reduces noise from irrelevant response data.

## Running Endpoint Evaluations

Custom Endpoints integrate seamlessly into Scorecard's evaluation workflow. Once configured, they appear as selectable systems in the Kickoff Run modal, making it simple to choose between testing your SDK-integrated applications or HTTP endpoints. This unified interface means teams can evaluate both code-integrated and standalone APIs using the same metrics and testsets.

The evaluation process runs identically to SDK-based systems, applying your selected metrics to endpoint responses and generating comprehensive performance reports. Teams benefit from consistent evaluation standards whether testing prototype APIs, production services, or third-party integrations.

## Dynamic Testing Capabilities

Custom Endpoints excel at dynamic testing through variable injection from your test cases. This powerful feature allows a single endpoint configuration to handle diverse test scenarios by automatically substituting testcase values into request bodies and headers. Teams can test hundreds of variations without creating separate endpoint configurations for each scenario.

The system automatically maps testcase fields to endpoint variables using simple template syntax. When you run evaluations, Scorecard iterates through your testset and dynamically generates unique requests for each test case. This approach dramatically reduces setup time while ensuring comprehensive test coverage across your API's functionality.

## Key Benefits

### No-Code Testing
Custom Endpoints eliminate the need for code integration when you want to test existing APIs. Teams can immediately start evaluating deployed services without modifying application code or adding SDK dependencies. This is particularly valuable for testing legacy systems, third-party APIs, or services owned by different teams.

### Flexible Testing Strategies
The platform supports various testing approaches from quick smoke tests to comprehensive regression testing. Teams can rapidly validate endpoint health with minimal test cases or conduct thorough evaluations using extensive testsets. The same endpoint configuration adapts to different testing intensities based on your current needs.

### Production Monitoring
Beyond one-time evaluations, Custom Endpoints enable continuous monitoring of deployed APIs. Set up automated testing schedules to catch performance degradations or functionality changes before they impact users. This proactive approach helps maintain service quality across deployments and infrastructure changes.

## Continuous Monitoring

Custom Endpoints support automated monitoring schedules that continuously validate your APIs without manual intervention. Configure monitoring frequency based on your service criticality, from every few minutes for mission-critical APIs to daily checks for internal tools. The system automatically tracks performance trends and alerts your team when metrics fall below acceptable thresholds.

## Common Use Cases

### API Testing Without Code Changes
Teams frequently use Custom Endpoints to test APIs they cannot or prefer not to instrument with SDKs. This includes legacy systems where code changes are risky, third-party APIs where integration isn't possible, and microservices owned by other teams. The no-code approach enables immediate testing without coordination overhead or deployment cycles.

### Multi-Environment Validation
Custom Endpoints excel at testing the same API across different environments. Configure separate endpoints for development, staging, and production versions of your API, then run identical testsets against each environment. This approach quickly identifies environment-specific issues and validates deployment consistency.

### External API Integration
Custom Endpoints enable testing of external APIs and third-party services within your evaluation framework. Teams can validate external dependencies, monitor service level agreements, and ensure consistent performance from vendors and partners. This capability helps maintain application reliability when depending on external services.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
Most connection problems stem from network accessibility or SSL configuration issues. Verify your endpoint URLs are publicly accessible and that SSL certificates are valid and current. Firewall restrictions often block testing traffic, so ensure Scorecard's IP ranges can reach your endpoints.

### Authentication Problems
Authentication failures typically occur when API keys expire or header formats are incorrect. Double-check that your credentials are active and properly formatted in the headers configuration. Many APIs require specific authentication schemes or token prefixes that must match exactly.

### Response Processing
Response parsing issues usually indicate mismatched expectations between your endpoint's actual response format and your JSONPath configuration. Validate that your response path expressions correctly navigate your API's response structure and handle nullable or optional fields appropriately.
