## Enterprise-Grade Security

Scorecard provides enterprise-grade authentication powered by Clerk, supporting SAML SSO, OIDC, and advanced security features for organizations of all sizes.

<Note>
  Enterprise authentication features are available on Scorecard's Pro and Enterprise plans, ensuring your organization meets compliance and security requirements.
</Note>

## SAML SSO Integration

### Supported Identity Providers

Scorecard supports all major enterprise identity providers:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Prebuilt Integrations">
    - **Microsoft Azure Active Directory**
    - **Google Workspace** 
    - **Okta Workforce**
    - **OneLogin**
    - **Auth0**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Custom SAML">
    Any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider including:
    - **PingIdentity**
    - **ForgeRock**
    - **ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services)**
    - **Shibboleth**
    - **Custom enterprise solutions**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Authentication Flows

<Info>
  Scorecard supports both SP-initiated and IdP-initiated SSO flows for maximum flexibility with your existing infrastructure.
</Info>

**Service Provider-Initiated (Recommended)**: Users begin their authentication journey from Scorecard, which provides enhanced security through a controlled authentication flow and delivers a better user experience with clear redirect paths.

**Identity Provider-Initiated**: Alternatively, users can start from your company portal, providing seamless integration with existing enterprise workflows and automatic redirection to the Scorecard dashboard after authentication.

## Organization Management

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

Scorecard's organization structure supports complex enterprise hierarchies:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript User Management
// Automatic organization assignment based on email domain
const user = {
  email: "user@company.com",
  organization: "company-org", // Auto-assigned
  role: "member" // or "admin"
}

// Users inherit organization permissions
// Projects and data are isolated by organization
```

```json SAML Configuration
{
  "entityId": "https://app.scorecard.io",
  "acsUrl": "https://app.scorecard.io/sso/saml/callback",
  "sloUrl": "https://app.scorecard.io/sso/saml/logout",
  "nameIdFormat": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress",
  "signatureAlgorithm": "RSA-SHA256"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Domain Management

Domain-based access control ensures only authorized users can access your organization. Scorecard verifies email domains before allowing users to join, and you can configure whether subdomains are allowed or restricted. This domain restriction mechanism prevents unauthorized access and maintains organizational boundaries.

### Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning

<Tip>
  JIT provisioning automatically creates user accounts during first-time SSO authentication, reducing administrative overhead.
</Tip>

When users authenticate via SSO for the first time, Scorecard automatically provisions their accounts. The system populates account attributes directly from SAML assertions, assigns organization membership based on domain rules, and maps roles according to SAML attributes provided by your identity provider.

**Attribute Mapping**:
```xml
<!-- Standard SAML attributes automatically mapped -->
<saml:Attribute Name="email">
  <saml:AttributeValue>user@company.com</saml:AttributeValue>
</saml:Attribute>
<saml:Attribute Name="firstName">
  <saml:AttributeValue>John</saml:AttributeValue>
</saml:Attribute>
<saml:Attribute Name="lastName">
  <saml:AttributeValue>Doe</saml:AttributeValue>
</saml:Attribute>
<saml:Attribute Name="role">
  <saml:AttributeValue>admin</saml:AttributeValue>
</saml:Attribute>
```

## Security Features

### Enterprise Security Standards

<Warning>
  Scorecard implements industry-standard security practices to protect your data and comply with enterprise security requirements.
</Warning>

Scorecard implements comprehensive security protections including CSRF (Cross-site request forgery) prevention, XSS (Cross-site scripting) mitigation, and secure session management with automatic rotation. The platform enforces industry-standard password policies and secure storage mechanisms, while rate limiting prevents brute force attacks and abuse attempts.

### Compliance & Auditing

Scorecard maintains SOC 2 Type II compliance through regular security audits and comprehensive data protection measures. All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, with complete access logging and audit trails for compliance reporting. The platform includes robust incident response procedures and continuously monitors user activity, tracking login events, API access, project interactions, and failed authentication attempts to ensure security and compliance.

## Setup Guide

### Configure SAML SSO

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact Scorecard Support">
    Reach out to enable enterprise authentication for your organization:
    - Email: support@scorecard.io
    - Include: Organization name, desired SSO provider, estimated user count
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Provide SAML Metadata">
    Share your IdP's SAML metadata with Scorecard:
    ```xml
    <!-- Example metadata structure -->
    <EntityDescriptor entityID="https://your-idp.com">
      <IDPSSODescriptor>
        <SingleSignOnService 
          Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
          Location="https://your-idp.com/sso" />
        <KeyDescriptor use="signing">
          <KeyInfo><X509Data>...</X509Data></KeyInfo>
        </KeyDescriptor>
      </IDPSSODescriptor>
    </EntityDescriptor>
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Your IdP">
    Add Scorecard as a service provider in your IdP:
    - **Entity ID**: `https://app.scorecard.io`
    - **ACS URL**: `https://app.scorecard.io/sso/saml/callback`
    - **SLO URL**: `https://app.scorecard.io/sso/saml/logout`
    - **Name ID Format**: Email address
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test and Activate">
    Scorecard team will configure and test the integration before activation
  </Step>
</Steps>

### User Experience

Once SAML SSO is configured, users experience a streamlined authentication process. They begin by visiting app.scorecard.io and clicking "Sign in with SSO", then enter their email domain which automatically redirects them to the appropriate identity provider. After completing authentication with your organization's IdP, their account is automatically provisioned on first login, granting immediate access to your organization's Scorecard projects.

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Organization Support

<Info>
  Enterprise customers can manage multiple organizations with separate SSO configurations and isolated data.
</Info>

Each organization operates in complete isolation with its own SAML configuration and independent user management. Projects and data remain strictly separated between organizations, while parent companies can still access cross-organization reporting for comprehensive oversight.

### Custom Attribute Mapping

Map additional SAML attributes to user profiles:

```xml
<!-- Custom attributes for role-based access -->
<saml:Attribute Name="department">
  <saml:AttributeValue>Engineering</saml:AttributeValue>
</saml:Attribute>
<saml:Attribute Name="team">
  <saml:AttributeValue>ML Platform</saml:AttributeValue>
</saml:Attribute>
<saml:Attribute Name="accessLevel">
  <saml:AttributeValue>admin</saml:AttributeValue>
</saml:Attribute>
```

### Session Management

Enterprise session controls provide granular security management through configurable session timeouts and forced re-authentication policies. Organizations can set concurrent session limits to prevent account sharing and implement device-based access controls for additional security layers.

## API Access with SSO

### API Key Management

Enterprise users can manage API keys through the dashboard:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import scorecard

# Use organization API key for programmatic access
client = scorecard.Client(
    api_key="sk_live_org_abc123...",  # Organization API key
    base_url="https://api.scorecard.io"
)

# All API calls inherit organization context
projects = client.projects.list()
```

```javascript JavaScript
import Scorecard from '@scorecard/client';

// Initialize with organization API key
const client = new Scorecard({
  apiKey: 'sk_live_org_abc123...',  // Organization API key
  baseUrl: 'https://api.scorecard.io'
});

// Organization context automatically applied
const projects = await client.projects.list();
```

```bash cURL
# Use organization API key in requests
curl -X GET https://api.scorecard.io/v2/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_org_abc123..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Service Accounts

Create service accounts for automated workflows:

- **CI/CD Integration**: Dedicated keys for deployment pipelines
- **Monitoring Systems**: Automated health checks and alerting
- **Data Sync**: Integration with internal analytics platforms
- **Audit Compliance**: Separate keys for compliance reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common SSO Issues

**Login Failures**:
- Verify SAML metadata is correctly configured
