title: 'Kick-off Run'
description: 'A single, consistent place to start an evaluation run—whether you let Scorecard handle everything or trigger your own GitHub Actions workflow.'

## Where you’ll run into it

* **Runs list** – spin up a fresh run from your project dashboard.  
* **Run detail → “Run Again”** – opens pre-filled with the original Testset, System Version, and Metrics.  
* **Testset list & Testset pages** – jump straight into a run with that Testset already selected.  
* **Project cards** – launch a run right from the projects overview.  
* **Prompt Playground** – refine a prompt, then kick off a run to see real scores.

## What you can do inside

1. **Choose a Testset** – the dataset you want to grade against.  
2. **Pick a System Version** – the exact model + prompt combo to test.  
3. **Select Metrics** – one or many evaluation metrics (your workspace admin can make this optional).  
4. **Tweak Model Settings** (Scorecard tab) – override model name, temperature, top-p, etc.  
5. **Pick a Repository** (GitHub tab) – dispatch your GitHub Actions workflow instead of running directly in Scorecard.

If you opened the modal from somewhere else (e.g. Run detail), we’ll pre-populate as many fields as possible so you’re just one click away.

## After you click **Kick-off Run**

* A toast confirms the run and includes a handy link.  
* A new tab opens to the run details (or the GitHub Actions page).  
  * Nothing pops up? Your browser’s popup blocker may need a quick “allow”.

Happy running! 🚀
