Scorecard **Monitors** periodically sample recent LLM spans, extract prompts and completions, and automatically score them with your selected metrics. The results appear where you work: on the **Traces** page (scored traces) and the **Runs** pages (history and per‑run aggregates).

## If you’re coming from other tools

- **What it is**: Very similar to observability dashboards (metrics over time, traces, filtering) — with one key addition: Scorecard runs **evaluations/auto‑scoring** on sampled traces, so you get quality metrics over time, not just system metrics.
- **Where scores show up**: Inline on **Traces** for each scored span, and in **Runs** where you can analyze run‑level aggregates and trends.
- **What’s evaluated**: Only spans that contain prompt and completion are scored; we support common keys (`openinference.*`, `ai.prompt`/`ai.response`, `gen_ai.*`).

## Create a Monitor

1. In the project sidebar select **Monitors** (<code>&lt;Icons.clock/&gt;</code>). You’ll land on the monitor overview page.
2. Click **“New Monitor +”** to open the Create Monitor modal.

/>

Inside the modal you can configure:

* **Metrics** – choose any evaluation metric you’ve defined (toxicity, factuality, latency…).
* **Frequency** – how often Scorecard samples traces (1 min, 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, 1 day).
* **Sample Rate** – throttle evaluation cost (1 %–100 %).
* **Filters** – hone in on traffic via <code>spanName</code>, <code>serviceName</code>, or full-text **searchText**.
* **Active** – flip a switch to pause / resume without losing config.

### Keyword filtering with SearchText

Use **SearchText** to match any keywords or phrases embedded in your traces. It searches across span and resource attributes (including prompt/response fields), so you can:

- Track sensitive topics (e.g., “refund policy”, “PCI”, “unsafe”) as dedicated monitors
- Isolate incident-related traffic and watch the quality recover
- Run targeted evaluations for specific features, intents, or cohorts

This turns production monitoring into topic-level QA: you’re not just watching everything, you’re watching the parts that matter.

Click **Create Monitor** and scoring starts on the next cycle.

## What happens after it runs

- Monitors sample recent AI spans using deterministic, hash‑based sampling (stable slices) and create a **Run**.
- Each sampled span is scored and appears inline on the **Traces** page with score chips; click any row to open the full trace.
- From a scored trace you can follow the link to the corresponding **Run** to see run‑level details.

## Where to view results

- **Traces**: Browse scored spans, filter by keywords with SearchText, and jump into details for debugging.
- **Runs**: See run history and performance over time, plus per‑run aggregates and plots on the run details pages.

## Manage monitors

- **Edit** a monitor to change metrics, sampling, filters or toggle **Active**.
- **Delete** a monitor to stop processing entirely.

## Best for

- Production monitoring of LLM quality and safety
- Auto-scoring on real user traffic
- Tracking model/prompt health over time
