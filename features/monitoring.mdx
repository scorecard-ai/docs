Scorecard **Monitors** run your chosen evaluation metrics on every production trace and surface trends in an interactive dashboard.

## Create a Monitor

1. In the project sidebar select **Monitors** (<code>&lt;Icons.clock/&gt;</code>). You’ll land on the monitor overview page.
2. Click **“New Monitor +”** to open the Create Monitor modal.

  caption="Create monitor modal."
  alt="Create monitor modal screenshot."
/>

Inside the modal you can configure:

* **Metrics** – choose any evaluation metric you’ve defined (toxicity, factuality, latency…).
* **Frequency** – how often Scorecard samples traces (1 min, 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, 1 day).
* **Sample Rate** – throttle evaluation cost (1 %–100 %).
* **Filters** – hone in on traffic via <code>spanName</code>, <code>serviceName</code>, or full-text **searchText**.
* **Active** – flip a switch to pause / resume without losing config.

Click **Create Monitor** and scoring starts on the next cycle.

## Edit or Delete

All monitors appear in the table. Use the **•••** menu to:

* **Edit** – change metrics, sampling, filters or deactivate/reactivate.
* **Delete** – remove the monitor entirely.

## Alert thresholds

Open the monitor detail page and add threshold rules per metric. When a rule is breached Scorecard triggers your configured notification channels (email, Slack, webhook → PagerDuty, Opsgenie).

## Reading the dashboard

The monitor view updates in real-time and shows:

- An aggregate score for each metric.
- Time-series sparkline to spot drifts.
- A table of the latest spans with their individual scores—click any row to jump to the full trace.

## Alerts

When a threshold is breached Scorecard can:

- Send an email to project members.
- Post to Slack or Microsoft Teams.
- Trigger a webhook for on-call rotations.

Configure integrations under **Settings → Integrations**.

## Best practices

Keep monitors tight and actionable:

- Start with 1-2 key metrics per project.
- Add a **Latency** metric to keep an eye on model response times.
- Review alerts; tune thresholds until you only get pings that matter.
