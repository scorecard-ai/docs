## Overview

The Playground is a visual workflow builder where you connect nodes to test your AI agent:

- **Testset** (left): Your test data flows into the agent
- **Agent** (center): Configure prompts and model settings
- **Evaluator** (top right): Select metrics to score outputs
- **Results**: View agent responses for each testcase
- **Scores**: See pass/fail status and metric scores

## Running an Evaluation

1. **Select a testset** or add testcases manually
2. **Configure your prompt** using [Jinja syntax](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) with variables like `{{context}}` or `{{allInputs}}`
3. **Add metrics** to the Evaluator node
4. **Click Run** to execute the evaluation

Results flow through the workflow—watch as responses appear in the Results node and scores populate in the Scores node.
