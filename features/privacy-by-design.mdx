## Data Encryption and Data Security

Scorecard AI takes extensive measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and overall security of your data.

* **Encryption:** Data is stored encrypted (using the AES-256 standard) and transmitted encrypted (using HTTPS/TLS protocols). This protects sensitive details such as access tokens and confidential information.
* **Data Erasure:** We erase data upon request or when it reaches its designated retention period, ensuring that outdated information isnâ€™t stored unnecessarily.
* **Physical Security:** Our cloud service providers ensure the physical security of the infrastructure where your data is stored using industry-standard encryption.
