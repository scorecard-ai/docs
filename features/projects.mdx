Scorecard uses a hierarchical structure to organize your evaluation work: **Organizations** contain multiple **Projects**, and each Project contains your testsets, metrics, runs, and results.

## Organizations

Organizations are the top-level entity in Scorecard that enables team collaboration and workspace isolation.

All members of an organization can access all projects within that organization. API keys are scoped to a specific _organization_, not user or project.

## Projects

Each project serves as a container for:

- **Testsets**: Collections of Testcases for evaluation
- **Metrics**: Custom evaluation criteria and scoring methods 
- **Records**: Evaluation executions and their results

### Creating a New Project

To create a project, click **"Create Project"** in the projects menu and go through the steps.

<Tip>
Choose a descriptive project name for the system or use case you're evaluating, such as "Customer Support Chatbot" or "Product Recommendation Engine."
