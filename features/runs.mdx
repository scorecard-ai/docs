A **Run** is an execution that evaluates your AI agent against some Testcases using specified metrics.

Runs generate **Records** (individual test executions) and **Scores** (evaluation results) for each Record that help you understand your agent's performance across different scenarios.

## What is a Run?

Every run consists of:

- (Optional) **Testset**: Collection of test cases to evaluate against
- (Optional) **Metrics**: Evaluation criteria that score system outputs
- (Optional) **System Version**: Configuration defining your AI system's behavior
- **Records**: Individual test executions, one per Testcase
- **Scores**: Evaluation results for each record against each metric

## Creating Runs

### Kickoff Run from the UI

You can kickoff a run from the Projects dashboard, Testsets list, or a Run ("Run again" button). The **Kickoff Run** modal lets you choose the Testset, Prompt, and Metrics for the run.

The **Scorecard** tab lets you run using an LLM on Scorecard's servers, so you can specify the LLM parameters. The **GitHub** tab lets you trigger a run using GitHub Actions on your actual system.

### From the Playground

The [Playground](/features/playground) allows you to test prompts interactively.

Click **Kickoff Run** to create a run with a specified testset, prompt version, and metrics.

<DarkLightImage lightSrc="/images/playground-light.png" caption="Playground overview." alt="Screenshot of the playground in the UI." />

### Using the API

You can create runs and records programmatically using the Scorecard SDK.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from scorecard_ai import Scorecard
from scorecard_ai.lib import run_and_evaluate

run = run_and_evaluate(
    client=Scorecard(),
    project_id="123",
    testset_id="456",
    metric_ids=["789", "101"],
    system=lambda system_input: ask_llm(system_input),
)
print(f'Go to {run["url"]} to view your results.')
```


```JavaScript JavaScript
import Scorecard, { runAndEvaluate } from 'scorecard-ai';

const scorecard = new Scorecard();

const run = await runAndEvaluate(scorecard, {
  projectId: "123",
  metricIds: ["789", "101"],
  testsetId: "456",
  system: (systemInput) => askLLM(systemInput),
});
console.log(`Go to ${run.url} to view your results.`);
```

</CodeGroup>

See the [SDK quickstart](/intro/quickstart) or [API reference](/api-reference/overview) for more details.

### Via GitHub Actions

Using Scorecard's [GitHub integration](/how-to-use-scorecard/trigger-run-with-github-actions), you can trigger runs automatically (e.g. on pull request or a schedule).

With the integration set up, you can also trigger runs of your real system from the Scorecard UI.

## Run status

- **ðŸŸ¡ Pending**: Run is created but there are no Records in the Run.
- **ðŸ”µ Scoring**: Records are being scored by AI or heuristic metrics, or are awaiting human scoring. The Run may still be awaiting more Records.
- **ðŸŸ¢ Completed**: All existing Records in the Run have been scored successfully.
- **ðŸ”´ Error**: An error occurred during execution or scoring of one or more Records.

<Note>
  **Completed** only means that all _existing_ Records in the Run have been scored. If you add more Records, the status will become **Scoring** until those new Records are also scored.
</Note>

## Inspect a Record

Drill down into specific test executions for detailed analysis:

**Record Overview:**

- **Inputs**: Original Testcase data sent to your system
- **Outputs**: Generated responses from your AI system
- **Expected Outputs**: Ideal responses for comparison
- **Scores**: Detailed evaluation results from each metric

## Export a Run

Click the **Export as CSV** button on the run details page.

## Run Notes

Click **Show Details** on a run page to view or edit the run notes and view the system/prompt version the run was executed with.

<DarkLightImage lightSrc="/images/run-notes-light.png" caption="Run details with notes and system configuration." alt="Screenshot of viewing run details with notes and system configuration in the UI." />

<Note>
  Run data includes potentially sensitive information from your Testsets and system outputs. Follow your organization's data handling policies and avoid including PII or confidential data in test configurations.
</Note>

## Run History

View your AI system's performance trends over time with interactive charts for each metric on the run list page.

Run history helps you identify performance trends, compare metrics side-by-side, and track consistency across runs.

<DarkLightImage lightSrc="/images/run-history-light.png" darkSrc="/images/run-history-dark.png" caption="Run history charts showing three metrics' performance over time." alt="Screenshot of run history charts displaying multiple metrics over time." />

Use the dropdown to select which metrics to display. Hover over any data point to see detailed run information and scores, with synchronized highlighting across all visible charts.

Binary metrics display as percentages (passing rate) while integer metrics show the average score for that metric.

  Click any metric title to navigate to its detailed configuration page.
