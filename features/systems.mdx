## You already know prompts

If you've used ChatGPT or any AI tool, you've written prompts:

> "Write a joke about programming"

And when you want to improve results, you tweak the prompt:

> "Write a **funny** joke about programming, **make it witty not cheesy**"

## But real AI Applications are more complex

In production, your AI might:

- Use multiple prompts working together
- Call different models for different tasks
- Adjust temperature, max tokens, and other parameters
- Process inputs through several steps
- Depend on context, rules, and configurations

Suddenly you're not managing one prompt—you're juggling an entire system of interconnected pieces.

## Enter: Systems

A System captures **all the moving parts** that affect your AI's behavior:

- Your prompts (yes, plural!)
- Model selection and parameters
- Processing steps and logic
- Any configuration that changes the output

Instead of tracking these pieces separately, a System bundles them into one testable unit.

## A simple example

Even a basic joke bot has multiple variables:

```
SYSTEM: Joke Bot

Inputs:
└── topic: "programming"

Configurations:
├── Model: "gpt-3.5" or "gpt-4"
├── Style: "dad-joke" or "witty"
├── Temperature: 0.5 to 1.0
└── (and any other settings that matter)

Output:
└── joke: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode?..."
```

Change any configuration, and you get different results. Systems let you test these variations systematically instead of guessing.

## Why this matters

- **Everything in one place**: No more scattered prompts and configs
- **Test combinations**: See how different settings work together
- **Track what works**: Know exactly which configuration is in production
- **Scale confidently**: From single prompts to multi-step workflows

## Your turn: build a joke bot in 5 minutes

The best way to understand Systems is to build one. We've created a simple example that shows the concept in action:

**[→ Try the Joke Bot Quickstart](https://github.com/scorecard-ai/scorecard-examples/tree/main/nodejs-jokebot)**

In just 5 minutes, you'll see how even a simple AI task benefits from thinking in Systems rather than individual prompts.
