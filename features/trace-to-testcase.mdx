title: "Trace ➜ Testcase"
description: "Turn production traces into reusable testcases and build datasets from real traffic."

import { DarkLightImage } from '/snippets/dark-light-image.jsx';

Live traffic uncovers edge-cases synthetic datasets rarely catch. **Trace ➜ Testcase** lets you capture those moments, convert them into structured testcases, and bake them into your regression suite—all without leaving the trace view. This is production-to-dataset in one click.

## If you call it something else

- **Traces → Testcases**: Similar to “snapshotting” production examples into a labeled dataset. Scorecard streamlines it in the trace UI and auto-maps prompt/completion fields.
- **Where testcases live**: Saved into **Testsets** so you can re-run evaluations and compare **Runs & Results** over time.
- **What’s extracted**: Prompt and completion are pulled from common keys (`openinference.*`, `ai.prompt`/`ai.response`, `gen_ai.*`).

## Why it matters

- Grow testsets from real user prompts and outputs.
- Reproduce tricky scenarios when evaluating new models or prompts.
- Track quality over time with consistent, production-grounded inputs.

## How it works

1. Open any trace and drill down to the span that contains the LLM call.
2. Click **Create Testcase** (document icon).
3. Pick a **Testset** or create a new one.
4. Scorecard auto-extracts the prompt and completion from span attributes (`openinference.*`, `ai.prompt` / `ai.response`, `gen_ai.*`). Adjust fields before saving.
5. The testcase appears immediately in the selected testset.

## Use cases

- create gold-standard datasets from production data
- run offline evaluations on real cases, and validate changes before deployment.
