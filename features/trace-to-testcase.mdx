Live traffic uncovers edge-cases synthetic datasets rarely catch. **Trace ➜ Testcase** lets you capture those moments, convert them into structured testcases, and bake them into your regression suite—all without leaving the trace view.

## Why it matters

Production prompts and outputs are a goldmine for improving evaluations. By promoting a trace to a testcase you can:

1. Reproduce tricky queries that surfaced in the wild.
2. Track how model or prompt changes impact the exact same scenario over time.
3. Grow your testsets organically as your users explore new corners of the problem space.

## How it works

1. Open any trace in Scorecard and drill down to the span that contains the LLM call.
2. Click **“Create Testcase”** (the <code>&lt;Icons.document/&gt;</code> button).
3. Pick a target **Testset** or create a new one.
4. Scorecard auto-extracts the prompt & completion using common telemetry keys (<code>openinference.*</code>, <code>ai.prompt</code>, <code>ai.response</code>, <code>gen_ai.*</code>). You can tweak the fields before saving.
5. See the new testcase immediately in the selected testset.

That’s it—next time you run an evaluation, this real-world input becomes part of your scoring.
