## Why Use GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions provides a powerful and flexible way to automate software development workflows. With GitHub Actions, you can perform various automated tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying your code directly from your GitHub repository. This can save time and reduce errors by automating repetitive tasks and enabling faster feedback loops. For example, you can configure your workflow to automatically build and test your code whenever a pull request is opened. This can help catch bugs and issues earlier in the development process.

Integrating Scorecard AI with GitHub supercharges your software development workflow. By leveraging Scorecard’s capabilities within your GitHub repository, you can automatically run end-to-end tests, analyze system behavior, and obtain actionable insights—all in an automated manner. Imagine a scenario where every pull request is automatically assessed by Scorecard, presenting comprehensive test results and feedback directly in GitHub.

### Benefits of Integration

* *Automated Testing:* For every push or pull request, Scorecard can automatically perform extensive end-to-end tests.
