The Claude Agent SDK is Anthropic's framework for building AI agents that can reason, use tools, and complete multi-step tasks. It includes built-in support for OpenTelemetry tracing, making it easy to capture detailed telemetry from your agent workflows.

This quickstart shows how to send traces from your Claude Agent SDK (Python v0.1.18+, TypeScript v0.1.71+) applications to Scorecard for observability, debugging, and evaluation.

<Info>
  **Using the standard Anthropic SDK?** Check out the general [Tracing Quickstart](/intro/tracing-quickstart) for the proxy method that works with any Anthropic client.

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up environment variables">
    Configure the OpenTelemetry exporter to send traces to Scorecard. You'll need your Scorecard API key from [Settings](https://app.scorecard.io/settings).

    ```bash
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer <your_scorecard_api_key>"
    export ENABLE_BETA_TRACING_DETAILED=1
    export BETA_TRACING_ENDPOINT="https://tracing.scorecard.io/otel"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `<your_scorecard_api_key>` with your actual Scorecard API key (starts with `ak_`).
    </Note>

    **Optional:** To send traces to a specific project, set the project ID:

    ```bash
    export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="scorecard.project_id=<your-project-id>"
    ```

    If not set, traces will default to your oldest project in the organization.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your agent">
    With the environment variables configured, run your Claude Agent SDK application. All agent activity is automatically traced.

    ```python title="example.py" [expandable]
    import anyio
    from claude_agent_sdk import (
        AssistantMessage,
        TextBlock,
        query,
    )

    async def main():
        async for message in query(prompt="What is 2 + 2?"):
            if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
                for block in message.content:
                    if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                        print(f"Claude: {block.text}")

    anyio.run(main)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="View traces in Scorecard">
    Navigate to the **Records** page in [Scorecard](https://app.scorecard.io) to see your agent traces.

    <Note>
      It may take 1-2 minutes for traces to appear on the Records page.
    </Note>

    Click on any record to view the full trace details, including the complete request/response data and model usage.

## What Gets Traced

The Claude Agent SDK automatically captures:

| Trace Data | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **LLM Calls** | Every `messages.create` call with full prompt and completion |
| **Tool Use** | Tool invocations, inputs, and outputs as nested spans |
| **Model Usage** | Input, output, and total token counts per call |
| **Model Info** | Model name, parameters, and configuration |
| **Errors** | Any failures with full error context |

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | Yes | Authentication header: `Authorization=Bearer <scorecard_api_key>` |
| `ENABLE_BETA_TRACING_DETAILED` | Yes | Set to `1` to enable detailed tracing |
| `BETA_TRACING_ENDPOINT` | Yes | OTLP endpoint URL (use `https://tracing.scorecard.io/otel` for Scorecard) |
| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | No | Set `scorecard.project_id=<id>` to target a specific project (defaults to oldest project) |
