## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is an eval/evaluation?">
    An **evaluation** (or "eval") is the process of systematically testing and measuring your AI system's performance against a set of test cases. In Scorecard, an evaluation involves:

    - **Testset**: A collection of input/output pairs to test against
    - **System**: The AI model, prompt, or API endpoint being evaluated
    - **Metrics**: Criteria used to score performance (accuracy, tone, safety, etc.)
    - **Record**: A single evaluation result capturing inputs, outputs, and scores

    Think of it like unit testing for AI - you define what good looks like, evaluate your system against test cases, and get quantitative scores to measure performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Scorecard differ from other AI evaluation tools?">
    Scorecard is **the simulation platform for agent self-improvement**. While most eval tools focus on observing and testing after deployment, Scorecard helps you proactively simulate thousands of realistic scenarios and apply expert judgment at scale — so you can ship frontier agent capabilities in days, not weeks.

    Scorecard also brings together AI researchers, engineers, and subject-matter experts into a single workflow. SMEs encode their knowledge into metrics and reward models instead of manually labeling production logs, while AI researchers build improvement flywheels instead of running QA cycles.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is simulation and how is it different from traditional evals?">
    **Simulation** is the process of running your AI agent through **thousands of realistic scenarios** to test and improve its capabilities — without relying on production traffic or manual review.

    Traditional eval approaches treat quality as a **QA problem**: wait for production logs, manually review cases, and fix issues one at a time. This breaks down as agents get more complex because:

    - **Coverage gaps**: You miss edge cases until real users hit them
    - **Slow feedback**: Collecting enough production data takes **days or weeks**
    - **Expert bottleneck**: SMEs spend time labeling individual cases instead of teaching the system what "good" looks like
    - **Ceiling on improvement**: You're limited to scenarios that happen to occur in production

    **Simulation flips this.** Instead of reacting to problems in production, you proactively generate the messy, realistic interactions your agent will encounter and get feedback in **minutes, not weeks**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Scorecard help agents self-improve?">
    Scorecard enables a **self-improvement loop** by combining realistic scenario simulation with **scalable expert judgment**:

    - **Expert judgment at scale**: Instead of waiting for SMEs to manually label production cases, encode their knowledge into [Critic Agent Metrics](/features/metrics) that act as **reward models** — applying expert judgment consistently across every scenario automatically.
    - **Fast feedback loops**: Evaluate your agent through **10,000+ scenarios in minutes**. Identify weaknesses, iterate, and validate improvements — all in the same day.
    - **Broad scenario coverage**: Test against **tool-calling workflows**, **edge cases and adversarial inputs**, **multi-turn conversations** *(coming soon)*, and **enterprise environments** *(coming soon)*.

    The result: your team's bottleneck moves from **feedback** (slow, getting slower) to **building** (fast, getting faster). Scorecard's evaluation data also serves as high-quality training data for **RLHF and reinforcement learning** pipelines.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What programming languages does Scorecard support?">
    Scorecard provides SDKs for:
    - **Python**: Full-featured SDK with all capabilities
    - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Complete Node.js and browser support
    - **REST API**: Universal HTTP access for any language
    - **Framework integrations**: Claude Agent SDK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, and more
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limits and Constraints

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the text limits in Scorecard?">
    Scorecard uses PostgreSQL which supports up to 1GB per text field - essentially unlimited for evaluation use cases. Practical limits are more likely to come from your AI model's context window than database constraints.
    
    For bulk imports and large datasets, file uploads support CSV, JSON, and JSONL formats. If you encounter limitations with particularly large datasets or need custom configurations, contact support@scorecard.io for assistance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there rate limits for API usage?">
    Scorecard implements rate limiting to ensure platform stability and fair usage across all customers. Rate limits vary by plan tier, with enterprise customers receiving custom limits based on their specific requirements.
    
    Rate limit information is included in API response headers for monitoring usage. If you need higher limits for your use case, contact support to discuss your requirements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the playbook text limit?">
    **Sim Agent Playbooks** (persona instructions for multi-turn simulation) have the following limits:
    
    - **Maximum playbook length**: 50KB of text
    - **Template variables**: Up to 100 variables per playbook
    - **Conversation turns**: Maximum 50 turns per simulation (safety limit)
    - **Stop conditions**: Up to 10 custom stop conditions per simulation
    
    Playbooks support Jinja2 templating for dynamic content and can reference any field from your test cases.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Features and Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does metadata work in Scorecard?">
    **Metadata** in Scorecard allows you to store additional context without affecting evaluations:
    
    **Testcase Metadata**:
    - Mark fields as "metadata" in testset schemas
    - Stored with test cases but excluded from evaluation logic
    - Useful for tracking source, difficulty, categories, etc.
    
    **Trace Metadata**:
    - Custom attributes on spans (user_id, session_id, etc.)
    - Model parameters and configuration data
    - Performance metrics and timing information
    
    **Run Metadata**:
    - Git commit SHA, branch information
    - Environment details (staging, production)
    - Custom tags and labels for organization
    
    Example usage:
    ```json
    {
      "input": "What's the weather?",
      "expected_output": "I'll help you check the weather",
      "source": "customer_support_logs",  // metadata
      "difficulty": "easy",              // metadata
      "created_by": "data_team"          // metadata
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is latency measured and reported?">
    Scorecard automatically captures **latency metrics** across your AI pipeline:
    
    **Measurement Points**:
    - **End-to-end latency**: Total request time from input to output
    - **Model inference time**: Time spent in model API calls
    - **Processing time**: Custom logic execution time
    - **Network latency**: Time spent in HTTP requests
    
    **Reporting**:
    - **Real-time dashboards**: Live latency monitoring
    - **Percentile analysis**: P50, P90, P95, P99 latency breakdown
    - **Trend analysis**: Latency over time with alerting
    - **Trace-level detail**: Individual request timing breakdowns
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Scorecard test agentic workflows and multi-step AI agents?">
