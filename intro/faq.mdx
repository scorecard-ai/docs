## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is an eval/evaluation?">
    An **evaluation** (or "eval") is the process of systematically testing and measuring your AI system's performance against a set of test cases. In Scorecard, an evaluation involves:
    
    - **Testset**: A collection of input/output pairs to test against
    - **System**: The AI model, prompt, or API endpoint being evaluated  
    - **Metrics**: Criteria used to score performance (accuracy, tone, safety, etc.)
    - **Run**: The execution of the evaluation across all test cases
    
    Think of it like unit testing for AI - you define what good looks like, run your system against test cases, and get quantitative scores to measure performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Scorecard differ from other AI evaluation tools?">
    Scorecard is designed to be **human-centric and cross-functional**, bringing together subject matter experts, product managers, and developers to collaboratively define and evaluate AI quality.
    
    Unlike developer-only tools, Scorecard enables non-technical stakeholders to contribute their domain expertise through intuitive interfaces for creating test cases and reviewing results. This collaborative approach ensures AI systems meet both technical requirements and real-world business needs, making it the evaluation platform for teams that want diverse perspectives in their AI quality process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What programming languages does Scorecard support?">
    Scorecard provides SDKs for:
    - **Python**: Full-featured SDK with all capabilities
    - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Complete Node.js and browser support
    - **REST API**: Universal HTTP access for any language
    - **Framework integrations**: LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, and more
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Scorecard be used for RLHF and agent training?">
    Yes, Scorecard evaluation data serves as high-quality feedback for reinforcement learning and agent improvement. By systematically evaluating agent outputs and capturing human preferences through custom metrics, teams can generate training datasets for RLHF workflows.
    
    The platform's testsets and evaluation results provide structured feedback loops that help identify agent weaknesses, create preference pairs for fine-tuning, and validate improvements through regression testing. This makes Scorecard valuable not just for evaluation, but as part of the continuous improvement cycle for AI agents.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limits and Constraints

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the text limits in Scorecard?">
    Scorecard uses PostgreSQL which supports up to 1GB per text field - essentially unlimited for evaluation use cases. Practical limits are more likely to come from your AI model's context window than database constraints.
    
    For bulk imports and large datasets, file uploads support CSV, JSON, and JSONL formats. If you encounter limitations with particularly large datasets or need custom configurations, contact support@scorecard.io for assistance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there rate limits for API usage?">
    Scorecard implements rate limiting to ensure platform stability and fair usage across all customers. Rate limits vary by plan tier, with enterprise customers receiving custom limits based on their specific requirements.
    
    Rate limit information is included in API response headers for monitoring usage. If you need higher limits for your use case, contact support to discuss your requirements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the playbook text limit?">
    **Sim Agent Playbooks** (persona instructions for multi-turn simulation) have the following limits:
    
    - **Maximum playbook length**: 50KB of text
    - **Template variables**: Up to 100 variables per playbook
    - **Conversation turns**: Maximum 50 turns per simulation (safety limit)
    - **Stop conditions**: Up to 10 custom stop conditions per simulation
    
    Playbooks support Jinja2 templating for dynamic content and can reference any field from your test cases.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Features and Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does metadata work in Scorecard?">
    **Metadata** in Scorecard allows you to store additional context without affecting evaluations:
    
    **Testcase Metadata**:
    - Mark fields as "metadata" in testset schemas
    - Stored with test cases but excluded from evaluation logic
    - Useful for tracking source, difficulty, categories, etc.
    
    **Trace Metadata**:
    - Custom attributes on spans (user_id, session_id, etc.)
    - Model parameters and configuration data
    - Performance metrics and timing information
    
    **Run Metadata**:
    - Git commit SHA, branch information
    - Environment details (staging, production)
    - Custom tags and labels for organization
    
    Example usage:
    ```json
    {
      "input": "What's the weather?",
      "expected_output": "I'll help you check the weather",
      "source": "customer_support_logs",  // metadata
      "difficulty": "easy",              // metadata
      "created_by": "data_team"          // metadata
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is latency measured and reported?">
    Scorecard automatically captures **latency metrics** across your AI pipeline:
    
    **Measurement Points**:
    - **End-to-end latency**: Total request time from input to output
    - **Model inference time**: Time spent in model API calls
    - **Processing time**: Custom logic execution time
    - **Network latency**: Time spent in HTTP requests
    
    **Reporting**:
    - **Real-time dashboards**: Live latency monitoring
    - **Percentile analysis**: P50, P90, P95, P99 latency breakdown
    - **Trend analysis**: Latency over time with alerting
    - **Trace-level detail**: Individual request timing breakdowns
    
    **Alerting**:
    ```python
    # Set up latency alerts
    alert = client.alerts.create(
        name="High Latency Alert",
        metric="p95_latency",
        threshold=5000,  # 5 seconds
        window="10m"
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Scorecard test agentic workflows and multi-step AI agents?">
    Yes! Scorecard is designed to test complex AI agents, not just simple prompts. Our platform supports:

    **Agentic Capabilities**:
    - **Multi-turn conversations**: Test agents across realistic conversation flows using Sim Agents

    - **Multi-step workflows**: Version complete agent configurations including prompts, tools, and routing logic
    - **Agent APIs**: Test deployed agent endpoints without code changes

    **How It Works**:
    - Use **Systems** to version your complete agent configuration (prompts + tools + settings)
    - Use **Multi-turn Simulation** to test conversational agents with automated user personas
    - Use **Custom Endpoints** to evaluate agent APIs and HTTP endpoints
    - Apply metrics to agent outputs just like any other evaluation
