## Key workflows

**To test a new AI application**: Create testsets → Run evaluations → Compare results → Deploy with confidence

**To catch regressions**: Set up golden testsets → Add to CI/CD → Get alerts for quality drops

**To improve existing systems**: Import production data → Identify failure patterns → Iterate systematically
