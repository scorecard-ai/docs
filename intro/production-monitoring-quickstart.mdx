Scorecard can evaluate live requests as they flow through your application. This guide shows how to stream spans to Scorecard, attach metrics, and watch dashboards light up.

## Steps
<Steps>
  <Step title="Instrument tracing (one-time)">
    Production monitoring relies on traces. Follow the <a href="/intro/tracing-quickstart">Tracing Quickstart</a> to connect your service and start sending spans. Once traces flow to your project, come back here to turn on continuous evaluation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure a Monitor">
    In the Scorecard UI open **Monitors → New Monitor**.

    1. Select the **project** that receives production traces.
    2. Pick the **metrics** you would like to run continuously (for example *toxicity* or *factuality*).
    3. Define **alert thresholds** (optional).

    <DarkLightImage
      lightSrc="/images/tracing-light.png"
      darkSrc="/images/tracing-dark.png"
      caption="Create monitor modal."
      alt="Create monitor modal screenshot."
    />
    **How sampling works**

    - Scorecard evaluates **every span** that contains both a prompt and completion.
    - Large projects are automatically down-sampled to keep latency low. Adjust the rate in **Monitor Settings**.

    <DarkLightImage
      lightSrc="/images/tracing-dark.png"
      darkSrc="/images/tracing.png"
      caption="Monitor settings – sampling rate."
      alt="Sampling rate UI screenshot."
    />

    **Filters & on/off switch**

    - Narrow evaluation to a subset of spans by <code>spanName</code>, <code>serviceName</code> or free-text <em>searchText</em>.
    - Toggle **Active** to pause/resume scoring without deleting the monitor.

    **Where prompts & completions come from**

    Scorecard looks at common OpenInference keys like `openinference.*`, `ai.prompt`, `ai.response`, and `gen_ai.*`. If you emit custom keys you can <em>map</em> them in the UI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch live dashboards">
    As soon as traces enter the monitor you’ll see scores, trends, and the latest spans.

    <DarkLightImage
      lightSrc="/images/tracing-light.png"
      darkSrc="/images/tracing-dark.png"
      caption="Monitoring dashboard."
      alt="Monitoring dashboard screenshot."
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What’s next?

- Connect a pager or Slack channel to be notified when a metric drifts.
- Use **Trace ➜ Testcase** to promote interesting spans into reusable testcases.
