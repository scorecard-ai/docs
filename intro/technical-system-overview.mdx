## Scorecard Workflow

The process of using the Scorecard platform consists of three general steps:

1. Ingest your data and add Testcases into Scorecard
2. Execute your Testcases on your LLM application
3. Score the responses of your LLM application

## Step 1: Ingestion

As first step, you add the data and interesting Testcases that are representative of your LLM use case in the Scorecard platform.

## Step 3: Scoring

As third and final step, the inputs and LLM-produced outputs for each Testcase will be scored - either automatically via Scorecard AI models or manually via your subject-matter experts.
