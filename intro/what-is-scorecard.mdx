Scorecard is the simulation platform for AI agent self-improvement. Run your agents through thousands of realistic scenarios in minutes, encode expert judgment into scalable reward models, and ship frontier capabilities in days.

## The bottleneck is feedback, not building

Teams are building increasingly complex agents — multi-step workflows, consequential actions, real-world integrations. But the way most teams validate these agents hasn't kept up. The current approach is manual: review a handful of production cases, wait weeks for expert feedback, and hope nothing slips through.

This limits you to scenarios you've already seen. Edge cases stay hidden until they hit production. Expert time doesn't scale — every new capability means more review cycles, longer iteration loops, and slower releases.

The bottleneck has shifted from building to feedback. Scorecard flips this by turning expert judgment into automated reward models and replacing manual review with large-scale simulation.

<Tip>
**Traditional approach:** Review tens of production cases over weeks.

**Scorecard approach:** Simulate tens of thousands of scenarios in 30 minutes.

## How Scorecard works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Encode expert judgment">
    Define reward criteria in natural language. Scorecard turns them into automated judges that score every scenario consistently and at scale.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Simulate at scale">
    Run your agent through thousands of realistic scenarios using AI-powered personas. Generate diverse test scenarios automatically — no manual case writing required.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare and improve">
    Quantitative A/B comparison across every metric. Iterate visually in the Playground with real-time feedback to find the best prompt, model, or architecture.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Ship with confidence">
    Integrate simulation into CI/CD so every pull request is validated automatically. Monitor production with tracing and feed real traffic back into your simulation suite.
