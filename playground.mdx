# Playground Quickstart Guide

The Playground is where you test and refine your AI prompts using real data. It's a three-panel interface that lets you select test data, edit prompts with Jinja templating, configure AI models, and see results in real-time.

## Getting Started

### 1. Select Your Test Data (Left Panel)

**Choose a Testset:**
- Click the testset dropdown at the top of the left panel
- Select a testset that contains the data you want to test your prompt against
- The first testcase will be automatically selected

**Select Testcases:**
- Click on individual testcases to select them
- Hold Shift and click to select multiple testcases
- Selected testcases have a blue left border
- Hover over the info icon (ⓘ) to see the full testcase data
- Testcases with a green flask icon (🧪) have been tested

### 2. Edit Your Prompt (Middle Panel)

**Choose a Prompt:**
- Select a prompt from the dropdown in the header
- If you don't have prompts yet, create one first in the Prompts section

**Work with Prompt Versions:**
- The left sidebar shows all versions of your selected prompt
- Click any version to switch to it
- Versions with unsaved changes show a dot indicator
- The production version is marked with a star

**Edit Prompt Templates:**
- Use the "Prompt Templates" tab to write your prompts
- The editor supports **Jinja syntax** for dynamic content
- Insert variables from your testcase data like `{{variable_name}}`
- Add multiple messages by clicking "+ Add Message"
- Set message roles (System, User, Assistant) using the dropdown
- Remove messages with the minus button

**Configure Model Settings:**
- Switch to the "Model Settings" tab
- Choose your AI model (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Adjust parameters like temperature, max tokens, and top-p
- These settings affect how the AI generates responses

### 3. Preview and Test (Right Panel)

**Template Preview:**
- The "Template Preview" tab shows how your prompt looks with real data
- Variables are automatically replaced with values from selected testcases
- This helps you verify your Jinja templating is working correctly

**Run Tests:**
- Click "Try" to test your prompt on selected testcases
- Click "Try All" to test on all testcases in the testset
- Results appear in the "Results" tab automatically

**View Results:**
- The "Results" tab shows AI responses for each testcase
- See response time, token count, and full output
- Click the completion badge to open a detailed results modal
- Green indicates successful completion, yellow shows partial results

## Key Features

### Jinja Templating
Your prompts support Jinja syntax for dynamic content:
```jinja
Hello {{name}}, your order #{{order_id}} is {{status}}.
```

### Multi-testcase Testing
- Test individual testcases for quick iteration
- Run all testcases for comprehensive evaluation
- Compare results across different prompt versions

### Version Management
- Save new versions of your prompts with the "Save" button
- Switch between versions to compare performance
- Publish versions to production when ready

### Real-time Preview
- See exactly how your prompt will look with real data
- Catch templating errors before running tests
- Understand how variables are populated

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Select one testcase first to quickly iterate on your prompt
2. **Use Variables**: Leverage Jinja templating to make prompts dynamic and reusable
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Run all testcases before publishing to production
4. **Save Versions**: Create new versions when making significant changes
5. **Monitor Results**: Check response times and token usage to optimize costs

## Common Workflows

**Quick Testing:**
1. Select a testcase → Edit prompt → Preview → Try → Review results

**Comprehensive Evaluation:**
1. Select all testcases → Edit prompt → Try All → Analyze results modal

**Version Comparison:**
1. Test Version A → Switch to Version B → Test → Compare results

The Playground makes prompt engineering intuitive by providing immediate feedback and real data testing in a single interface.
